                    Boxer is a medium to large,
                    short-haired dog breed of mastiff-type, developed in Germany. The coat is smooth and tight-fitting;
                    colors are fawn, brindled, or white, with or without white markings. Boxers are brachycephalic (they
                    have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong
                    jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old
                    English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than
                    by a decadence of the breed. The Boxer is a member of both The Kennel Club and American Kennel Club
                    (AKC) Working Group. </p>

                    bull is a term used in the United
                    States for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers, while in other countries such as the
                    United Kingdom the term is used as an abbreviation of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed.[1][2][3]
                    The term was first used in 1927.[3] Within the United States the pit bull is usually considered a
                    heterogeneous grouping that includes the breeds American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire
                    Terrier, American Bully, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and occasionally the American Bulldog, along
                    with any crossbred dog that shares certain physical characteristics with these breeds. In other
                    countries including Britain, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is not considered a pit bull.[1][4][5]
                    Most pit bull-type dogs descend from the British Bull and terrier, a 19th-century dog-fighting type
                    developed from crosses between the Old English Bulldog and the Old English Terrier. </p>

                    1878, a committee was formed in
                    Berlin which changed the name of the "Englische Dogge" (English mastiff derivatives) to "Deutsche
                    Dogge" (German mastiff), this being the Great Dane. This laid the foundations from which the breed
                    was developed.[17] During the 19th century, the dog was known as a "German boarhound" in
                    English-speaking countries.[18] Some German breeders tried to introduce the names "German Dogge" and
                    "German Mastiff" on the English market, because they believed the breed should be marketed as a dog
                    of luxury and not as a working dog.[7] However, due to the increasing tensions between Germany and
                    other countries, the dog later became referred to as a "Great Dane", after the grand danois[19] in

                    Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European
                    settlers in Newfoundland, were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and
                    Poole in Dorsetshire. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as
                    the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch,
                    the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger
                    Newfoundland and the Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser
                    Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not
                    larger than an English Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with
                    a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the
                    Newfoundland.[5] Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the "proper Labrador" and St.
                    John's breed of these dogs[5][6] in the fifth edition of his book Introductions to Young Sportsman,
                    published in 1846 </p>
