                    <p class="lh-base" style="font-size: 20px;padding-left: 30px;"> Start training your dog to stay with you
                        by slowly walking away from it, then calling its name and rewarding it with a treat when it
                        comes to you..... You can even add to this training by spending time with friends, having
                        them call your dog, and giving it a treat when it comes to them.</p>
                    <p class="lh-base" style="font-size: 20px;padding-left: 30px;"> This is also the period of time when most dogs begin to run away. Breed,
                        individual
                        genetics, life learning and sex can affect a dogâ€™s desire to run.... We can also
                        inadvertently
                        teach them to run away by chasing them. To the dog, it becomes a big game.... No matter the
                        cause, running away is a preventable behavior if you use patience, consistency and proper
                        training...</p>
